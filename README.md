This repository contains code examples for performing various operations on AWS S3 Storage using the .NET SDK. The operations include uploading, deleting, retrieving, and listing files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK installed on your machine.
- AWS Account with an S3 bucket.
- AWS Access Key and Secret Key.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AWSS3Storage.API.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd AWSS3Storage.API
   ```

3. Install the required NuGet package:
   ```
   dotnet add package AWSSDK.S3
   ```

4. Update `launchsettings.json` to include environment variables:
   ```json
   {
     "profiles": {
       "IIS Express": {
         "commandName": "IISExpress",
         "environmentVariables": {
           "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
           "AWSAccessKey": "YourAWSAccessKey",
           "AWSSecretKey": "YourAWSSecretKey",
           "AWSBucketName": "YourBucketName"
         }
       },
       "YourProjectName": {
         "commandName": "Project",
         "dotnetRunMessages": true,
         "environmentVariables": {
           "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
           "AWSAccessKey": "YourAWSAccessKey",
           "AWSSecretKey": "YourAWSSecretKey",
           "AWSBucketName": "YourBucketName"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Usage

### Upload a File
```csharp
var s3Client = new AmazonS3Client(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AWSAccessKey"), Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AWSSecretKey"), RegionEndpoint.USEast1);
var putRequest = new PutObjectRequest
{
    BucketName = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AWSBucketName"),
    Key = "YourFileName",
    FilePath = "YourFilePath"
};
await s3Client.PutObjectAsync(putRequest);
```

### Delete a File
```csharp
var deleteRequest = new DeleteObjectRequest
{
    BucketName = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AWSBucketName"),
    Key = "YourFileName"
};
await s3Client.DeleteObjectAsync(deleteRequest);
```

### List Files
```csharp
var listRequest = new ListObjectsV2Request
{
    BucketName = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AWSBucketName")
};
var listResponse = await s3Client.ListObjectsV2Async(listRequest);
foreach (var s3Object in listResponse.S3Objects)
{
    Console.WriteLine(s3Object.Key);
}
```
